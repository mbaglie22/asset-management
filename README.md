# Asset Management
This Github repository contains the solution to the "Portfolio Theory and Performance Analysis" assignment. The assignment involves two parts: equal risk-contribution portfolios and performance analysis. The first part focuses on constructing and backtesting portfolios with equal risk contribution weights, while the second part involves analyzing the performance of the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio and computing alpha, tracking error, and information ratios relative to the CAPM and Fama-French three factor benchmarks over different time periods. The code is written in Python, using popular data science libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and SciPy. The repository includes a Jupyter notebook with the detailed solution and necessary data files.
